# Avalonia.Xaml.Interactions.Animated

**Avalonia.Xaml.Interactions.Animated** is a simple library for Avalonia UI that introduces smooth animation support for vertical scrolling in the `ScrollViewer`. This library adds a smooth scroll effect to improve the user experience, especially for content with a lot of scrolling.

## Usage

To use `VerticalScrollViewerAnimatedBehavior` in your `.axaml` files, follow these steps:

```

### Step 2: Attach the Behavior
The animation effect is very easy to apply. Simply add `<ia:VerticalScrollViewerAnimatedBehavior/>` to the `Interaction.Behaviors` collection of your ScrollViewer:

```xml
<ScrollViewer Grid.Row="1" VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto" HorizontalScrollBarVisibility="Hidden">
  <Interaction.Behaviors>
    <ia:VerticalScrollViewerAnimatedBehavior/>
  </Interaction.Behaviors>
  
  <!-- Content for scrolling -->
</ScrollViewer>
```
